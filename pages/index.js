          <p>
            The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Red Five standing by. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

            You don't believe in the Force, do you? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Red Five standing by. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

            I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

            I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

            I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

            No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

            You don't believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

            I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.
