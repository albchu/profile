      <p>
        I&apos;m a web developer that enjoys pragmatically solving complex
        problems. I am comfortable working all over the tech stack but I hold a
        special spot in my heart for frontend development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Building great user experiences while bringing beautiful designs to life
        is a driving force in my career. I want to make major impacts in
        interesting projects to deliver value in meaningful ways.

        In the winter, you can find me hurtling myself off mountains on my
        snowboard. In the summer, I enjoy golf, and patio beers with friends. At
        all times of the year, I&apos;m typically hanging out with my wife and
        dog.
