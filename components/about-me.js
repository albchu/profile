      <p>
        Born and raised in Canada, I&apos;m a web developer by trade that enjoys pragmatically solving complex problems. I am comfortable working all over the tech stack but I hold a special spot in my heart for frontend development. Building great user experiences while bringing beautiful designs to life is a driving force in my career. I want to make major impacts in interesting projects that deliver value to users in meaningful ways.

        In the winter, you can find me in the mountains hurtling myself off mountains on my snowboard. In the summer, I enjoy golf, and patio beers with friends. At all times of the year, I&apos;m typically hanging out with my wife and dog.

This will show that you have taken the time to evaluate me for skill fit and I promise that I will evaluate your role as thoroughly as you have evaluated my profile.</p>
