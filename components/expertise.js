      <h5>React.js</h5>
      <p>I have been developing with React.js since 2017. At this point in my career, I am very confident that I can be thrown into any random part of a React frontend codebase and be able to figure it out quickly.</p>

      <br />

      <h5>Node.js</h5>
      <p>As much time as I have spent developing with React, I've been developing with Javascript for longer. From my University days of writing scrapers to liberate text books to building and deploying production Node.js applications across an entire stack, Javascript (and more specifically Node.js applications) have been the bread and butter of my career.</p>

      <br />

      <h5>Attention to detail</h5>

      <p>An aspect of my professional career that I adore is collaborating with designers. It is important to me to ensure that their intent for a feature is realized fully. Over the course of my career, I have developed a keen eye for identifying all the little details of a design so that nothing gets lost in translation from Figma to prod deployment.</p>

      <br />

      <h5>Quality Software</h5>
      <p>
        Writing production quality software doesn't stop at keeping up with latest in the software development zeitgeist. You need to have high quality tests to ensure that functionality always works as intended.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a developer that started in QA automation, I have always prioritized the importance of testing in development. As such, I have a lot of experience developing clear and testable code.
